need a way to check attendance of each student
1. Needs to work for each individual and the entire classroom at the same time
2. Must be able to be more or less efficient when taking attendance

//works
ideas: Move all students into an array, the array being a given day, and give
each student a value of true or false on if they attended the given day. Create
a table for each given day to see if someone was present on a given day. 7/10

Give each student their own attendance log. For each given day, create a time
table on whether they were present, simply showing "yes" or "no" if they were
present. 5/10
//wishlist
different classes, assign kids to a different classroom
link too google maps with address of parents
//if possible
Add way to upload student picture for attendance
