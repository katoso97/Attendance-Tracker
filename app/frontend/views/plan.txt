ideas: Move all students into an array, the array being a given day, and give
each student a value of true or false on if they attended the given day. Create
a table for each given day to see if someone was present on a given day. 7/10

Give each student their own attendance log. For each given day, create a time
table on whether they were present, simply showing "yes" or "no" if they were
present. 5/10
